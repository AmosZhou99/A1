				<div class="entry">
					<p>
						1.As we all know, IT industry can contain many branches such as hardware, software, cloud
						computing, web programming etc. As a freshman, I really don’t have many ideas about what they
						are or what field I will major at. Therefore, only regarding to interest of IT, data-related
						subjects seem to be appealing. Mainly because the IT industry is built on the information. So
						I believe how we will deal with that numerous data is vital for the future. Especially, when I
						saw the Britain TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War which mainly tells about how a group people use
						data analysis to find out those who is easy to be neglected by competitors in order to change
						the whole political situation of Britain.
					</p>
					<p>
						2. The reason why I chose RMIT mainly is that I joined a 2+2 program. RMIT is the most
						prestigious
						university among all the colleges my university in China has collaborated with. Furthermore,
						RMIT is well-known for teaching practical skills which may let me be more suitable to current IT
						market and RMIT’s IT major ranked very high around the world as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						3. Through my following two years, I hope I can learn about IT industry more systematically and
						have a better view of which field is most suitable for me. Besides, I also hope I can obtain
						enough skills to make a living and know how to improve professional skills by myself.

				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Ideal Job</a></h2>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>With great interest in data analysis, it seems data management is a more suitable path for me.
						Therefore, after searching job information about data. Data Analyst seems to be very appealing.
					</p>
					<p>According to the description of website, this company is trying to build AI to manage large
						amount of data automatically and transfers data into meaning results. Finally, use these results
						to make further business decisions which interests me a lot. Besides, this job is really
						well-paid which is $110k per year.
						Regarding to the skills it demands, firstly, it requires a lot of analytical languages such as
						R, SAS and has a deep understanding of Python. Second, excelling at dealing with database and
						data warehouse which need me to be really familiar with Oracle, SQL, Unix Shell etc.
						Furthermore, Cloud computing and Big Data Analysis are pretty essential to this job which means
						I should understand the basic structure and principles of that so that I can do data mining
						among all the data. At last, it also has requirements on Software Development. Therefore, Java
						and Web programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript) are in need. Because it is a senior level job, a
						minimum of five years’ working experience is necessary.
						As for my skill, because it is my first year here, so I am quite unfamiliar with these skills.
						However, due to the fact that I have already learned IT in China for two years, I know basic
						concepts of database and use SQL to seek information. Besides, I also leaned coding languages
						like Python, Java, C, C#, but I am not so that good at those enough to apply for a job. Finally,
						I also know a bit of web programming using html to set up static websites. Unfortunately, I
						haven’t done any internship which means I don’t have any working experience.
						For my future plan, I need to finish my degree first. During that period, maybe find some
						internship online to get to know IT industry. Besides, developing my coding skill especially
						Java and Python. Do more exercises to let me get more and more familiar with the compliers.
						Furthermore, I have strong interest in data managing. So, it is better for me to choose courses
						like cloud computing in order to be more qualified and specific in this field.

				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Personal Profile</a></h2>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As recommending in detailed file, I took three online tests online which are 16personalities
						test, Myers-Briggs test and learning style respectively.</p>
					<p>


						16personalities test:


						According to the website, I have the Defender personality which means I have excellent
						analytical abilities and be receptive to new ideas. As for the further report, personality like
						defenders often is more supportive, reliable and observant. Besides, defenders are loyal and
						hard-working and have good practical skills. However, defenders also have weakness such as
						taking things too personally and easily to overload. Furthermore, it is pretty easy for
						defenders to be taken advantages by others. The website also indicates that people having this
						personality are the backbone of the modern workforce and good at supporting their coworkers and
						customers. Finally, few personality types are as practical and dedicated as Defenders. Known for
						their reliability and altruism, Defenders are good at creating and maintaining a secure and
						stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Defenders’ dedication is invaluable in
						many areas, including their own personal growth.
					</p>



					<p>
						Myers-Briggs test:

						Due to the result of this website, it seems that there are two personalities (ISFJ, INFJ)
						applying to me because I have only 1% preference of sensing over intuition. Because of this
						test, I see more possibilities of me as an ISNJ. After reading both personalities’
						characteristics, there are plenty in common especially in career choices aspect. As a result,
						maybe it is more suitable for me to do some substantial intellectual work. In IT industry,
						website recommends me doing more job in computer science and software engineering.

					</p>
					<P>
						learning style test:
						result:

						In this part of test, apparently, I am a visual learner. Therefore, every time when I want to
						remember information, maybe it is better for me to close eyes and visualize information.
						Besides, using highlighter pens and drawing more visual symbols and diagrams may help me to be
						more efficient during the class.

					</P>

					<P>
						Conclusion:
						Those tests really broaden my horizon and offer a new prospective to identify me again. Although
						I am not the exact type of test result, maybe my personality is very close to that type. I can
						learn more about me through tests especially when I know the strengths, weaknesses of my
						personality. The results will advise me to make a better decision of my future career paths.
						If I am going to work in a team, I will try to do my part as the websites advised to see if it
						affects me in a positive way or not. Then, I will change my studying habit accordingly.
						When forming a team, it is better for us to take personality into consideration in an
						appropriate degree. Because personality does not decide your working ability. Those personality
						tests can only advise you which work is easier for you to find most fulfilled instead of
						informing you that you cannot do that. Therefore, I think it is better to give everybody a
						chance rather than choose certain type of people.

				<h2 class="title"><a href="#">Project Ideas</a></h2>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Overview:
						My project idea is to make a simple game using Unity. Its name is 2D-Ball based on a very famous
						game called 3D Pin-Ball. Due to the fact that I used to play this game through WeChat
						microprogram, it is very fun and seems not that hard for starters to make it come true.
						Therefore, I decided to make this game for my following assignment.

					</p>
					<p>Motivation:
						Mainly because I am a starter for IT industry, it will be hard to realize the complicated
						program. Simple game like 2D-Ball is not only a challenge for starters but a good chance to
						learn computer graphics concepts and put them into practice. The most of all, it is doable and I
						have clues on where to start especially I have learned some basic concepts in computer graphics
						by OpenGL.

					</p>
					<p>
						Description:
						After seeking for information online, making a 2D game basically need two steps. The first step
						is to build the scene using Unity or other graphic tools. As a start of the scene, it is better
						for us to build boundaries like walls to limit the moving space for balls. Choosing special
						material textures to make sure ball can bounce back from the wall. Then, make the ways for the
						ball to make sure the ball can bounce following physical rules. Next, set up a muzzle for the
						ball to define the start point. Add a text object in order to record the scores which counts the
						bouncing times of the ball. Then, put a level panel into the scene mainly to divide the scene
						into a lot of grids which will be filled with obstacles randomly. The whole structure of game
						will be done at that point. However, we still need a camera to fix the scene in 2D. After that
						it is time to decorate the scene, creating certain simple geometric figures to be the obstacles
						and adding some stunts using certain letters to stand for its function. For example, we can add
						a number into the geometric figure to stand for its remaining times to be bounced or add a
						letter ‘B’ for Big to make the ball bigger for some time. After all the procedures, I think we
						finish building the scene. It comes to the next step, writing codes to make the scene work as a
						game. First, I believe plenty of generators are necessary to generate all the obstacles and
						stunts. Besides, we need a state monitor to record what state we are in such as achieving game
						goal or already game over. Next, we should create a ball state monitor as well to record which
						state the ball is in, for example if the ball gets any stunts. For the ball, we still need an
						interactive system to make it work when the ball meets any obstacles and when it happens, we
						should decrease number of the obstacle. Further, we need a detector to see if any ball reaches
						the bottom of the scene and set an action to make the ball return to the muzzle so that player
						can launch the ball again. After that, an aiming system is essential in order that we can only
						use mouse to let the ball launch at the right angle towards bottom. In order to monitor all the
						status of obstacles, we can set a monitor on each obstacle to record the status. If obstacle’s
						number counts back to zero, it will vanish automatically. Setting an action on all the stunts
						which will deliver a message to change the state of the ball, which may make the ball bigger or
						make a clone of the ball itself. Finally, we just need one more recorder for the state of the
						game itself to pop up the main menu when game is over or paused. Combining two steps together, I
						think this game will work.

					</p>
					<P>
						Tools and Technologies:
						Unity is the main tool for this project, it is a powerful cross-platform game engine. Plus, it
						needs to be coded by some basic coding languages such as C++ and C#.

					</P>
					<P>
						Skills Required:
						C# language is mainly needed for coding in Unity. Although I only know some basic concepts of
						C#, there are plenty of tutoring videos and I can use the resources of library teaching how to
						use Unity to develop a simple game.

					</P>
					<p>
						Outcome:
						If I can finish my game successfully, it will look like the picture below.I hope it will work
						functionally because there are plenty of coding to do. Some of them are still in the planning
						stage, it is uncertain if I can conquer them without having a bug.
